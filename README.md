Scripts which I wouldn't like to loose even if there's nothing fancy in here.

Docker related scripts:  
doev - instead of typing eval "$(docker-machine env [machine-name])"  
dup - docker-compose build and up as I keep forgetting about rebuilding...

Most used stuff:  
essh - another layer added on top of ssh for faster operation on known servers  
rtmux - starts tmux (terminal multiplexer) with my favourite setup of windows/panes

Some old stuff:  
massreplace - recoursive mass replace string in files, it's not bullet-proof, created somewhere in 2013  
touchpadtoggle - toggles touchpad ;} created somewhere in 2013
